## webscrapers (and other such things!)

Thanks for checking out my sample code! I wrote these to automate some of the more inefficient parts of my (and my collegue's) jobs, and because I needed to start putting the coding skills that I've been learning into practice.

The ruby script is built to pull timely financial data from a group of different publicly available sources. It uses [Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/) and built in tools such as Open-URI.

The "javascript" code is actually Google App Script that I created to automatically pull API data, parse it, and then turn that data into larger content using Google Sheets.
